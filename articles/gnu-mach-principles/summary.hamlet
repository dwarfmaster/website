    is the microkernel developed for the Hurd system. It is a free (as in free
    speech) working microkernel. Despite its power, it is not very used and
    thus the documentation is lacking. This article aims to cover the principles
    of the mach kernel, and some of its API, to ease the development of any
    mach based system.
