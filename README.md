=======

The code for my website (Haskell Yesod).

Articles are directly written in hamlet (with a preprocessing with m4) in this
tree. The sources can be found in the `haskell` directory.

An old ruby version using Mysql as its database and txt2tags to parse the
markdown format for articles is in the `ruby` directory.

An old version using perl and Xapian can be found under the `perl` directory.
